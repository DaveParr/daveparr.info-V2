# I'm Dave

I work a lot with Python and R, and am most interested on how data science can save the planet.

I've been involved in a number of companies, mostly working on that saving the planet thing. You can [check out my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidrgparr/) for all that proffesional stuff.

I've been involved in a number of things that weren't companies too, mostly working on  data science communities for both [The Cardiff R User Group](https://www.meetup.com/Cardiff-R-User-Group/) and [PyData Cardiff](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Cardiff-Meetup/). I've also given talks at [PyData Bristol](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Bristol/) and [SatRdays Budapest](https://satrdays.org/tags/budapest/).

I'm currently working on a number of projects. You can see what I've been working on at [my GitHub](https://github.com/DaveParr).

I like cycling to work, gardening, and occasionally making things like the desk I'm working at right now.
