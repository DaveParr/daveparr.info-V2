I'm working through [Django for Beginners by William S. Vincent](https://djangoforbeginners.com/). The first part is about setting up your dev environment. The book is setup to start for a _complete_ beginner level, which is really nice. It starts from introducing the basics of the CLI for both Mac and Windows systems, and then some simple terminal commands with `cd`, `ls` etc.

It then goes on to help with installation of Python3, `git`, `pipenv` and `django`, all great stuff for getting started, plus it set's a great baseline for the rest of the book.

For anyone who has worked at all with terminals, version control, isolating environments and code editors, 90% of this will be already done on the machine, but I still think it's worth putting in. Having it laid out for you at the start of your programming experience that version control and the terminal are part of the process I think helps with the hump I've seen in more experienced beginners where `git` and `pipenv` are Yet Another Thing To Learn and so get pushed back in the learning pathway more out of fear than anything else.

Personally, I zipped through the setup in a few minutes. Hello World django app next!

Has anyone else seen the 'git is yet another thing to learn' hump? Maybe even had it? How did you overcome it?
